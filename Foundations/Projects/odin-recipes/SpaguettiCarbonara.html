    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper. It's creamy, delicious, and easy to make.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Pancetta</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add pancetta and garlic; cook until pancetta is crispy and garlic is fragrant, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together eggs and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined.</li>
        <li>Drain spaghetti, reserving some pasta water. Quickly toss hot spaghetti in the skillet with pancetta and garlic.</li>
        <li>Remove skillet from heat and quickly pour in egg mixture, tossing constantly to create a creamy sauce. Add reserved pasta water as needed to reach desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Season with black pepper and salt to taste. Serve immediately with extra Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
    </ol>
